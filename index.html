    <h1>AKAN PEOPLE</h1>
    <p>From the 15th century to the 19th century, the Akan people dominated gold mining and the gold trade in the region.
        From the 17th century on, the Akan were among the most powerful group(s) in west Africa. They fought many
        battles against the European colonists to maintain autonomy. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, enslaved Akans
        such as the Coromantins of Jamaica and descendants of the Akwamu in St. John, and many others were responsible
        for many slave rebellions in the new world.
        By the early 1900s, all Akan lands in Africa were colonized or protectorates of the French and English. On the 6th of
        March 1957, Akan lands in the Gold Coast rejected British rule, by the efforts of Kwame Nkrumah, and were joined
        with British Togoland to form the independent nation of Ghana. The Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August 1960s</p>
